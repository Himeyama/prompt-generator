PromptGenerator is a simple image generation tool that constructs a UI based on a prompt definition file, enabling easy image generation through a local AI environment.

## System Overview
![system-structure](docs/structure.drawio.png)

## Installation Requirements
- Windows 11 installed
- A PC equipped with an NVIDIA GPU
- `uv` command installed
- [genimage](https://github.com/Himeyama/genimage) installed
- Model files prepared

## Runtime Requirements
- Prompt definition file placed in the correct directory
- MCP configuration completed

## Prompt Definition File
Prompt definitions are stored in: `C:\Users<USERNAME>\prompt-generator\prompts.json`

### Example Prompt Configuration
See: [prompts.json](docs/prompts.json)

## MCP Configuration
PromptGenerator communicates with [genimage](https://github.com/Himeyama/genimage) via MCP (Model Context Protocol).  
Therefore, an MCP configuration file is required.

Create the configuration file at: `C:\Users<USERNAME>\prompt-generator\mcp_config.json`

If `genimage` is installed on Windows, an example configuration is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "genimage": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "C:/Users/<USERNAME>/genimage",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "main",
        "--model",
        "models/<MODEL>.safetensors",
        "--mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Output Images
Generated images appear on the right side of the application UI, and are also saved to: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\prompt-generator\images\`
